Forked from [# https-github.com-sonicretro-mania-mod-loader-2021](https://github.com/sonicretro/mania-mod-loader) to be able to expand on its code base in Visual Studio 2019 / 2022 and add some custom features (for my son) :)

Development requirements - install as individual components through Visual Studio installer.
- C++ Windows XP Support for Visual Studio.
- Windows 10 SDK

Make sure to take a look at README.txt in /ManiaModManager folder to avoid trouble building the project and running it locally.
